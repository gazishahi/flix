### Notes
- I had issues with the backdrop image overlapping the poster image in my details screen. I just repositioned the image views to resolve this.
- I noticed some movies (like The Flash (2022) and The Flash (1990)) had no backdrops which would cause crashes. I resolved this issue by changing 'let backdropPath = movie["backdrop_path"] as! String' to 'let backdropPath = (movie["backdrop_path"] as? String) ?? "0"' .

### Notes
- My Mac runs on the M1 chip and I ran into some issues with installing CocoaPods. A few lines in the terminal solved my issue.
- I'm simulating my app with the iPhone 12 and my launch screen image was shifted to the side. I had to reposition it since my storyboard was being viewed as an iPhone 11 Pro.
