### Notes
- My Mac runs on the M1 chip and I ran into some issues with installing CocoaPods. A few lines in the terminal solved my issue.
- I'm simulating my app with the iPhone 12 and my launch screen image was shifted to the side. I had to reposition it since my storyboard was being viewed as an iPhone 11 Pro.
